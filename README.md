## Repository Structure

Each directory within this repository corresponds to an individual exercise or project from the NLP course:

- `Exercise_1/`: Introduction to language models, including bigram models and Viterbi algorithm applications.
- `Exercise_2/`: Advanced exploration of HMMs and POS tagging with various smoothing techniques.
- `Exercise_3/`: Sentiment analysis using simple log-linear, Word2Vec, and LSTM models.
- `Exercise_4/`: Text classification using Transformer models and a comparison with traditional methods.

Each exercise includes:

- Python scripts with implementations of the NLP concepts.
- `requirements.txt` file with necessary Python package dependencies.
- Reports in PDF format that detail the methodologies, results, and insights for each task.

## Installation

To install dependencies for an individual exercise, navigate to the exercise's directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each exercise directory contains a README with specific instructions for running the Python scripts and analyzing the results.
